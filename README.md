# RL_Taxi
First RL agent (Q learning)
Taxi-v3 Reinforcement Learning Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent using the Q-learning algorithm to solve the Taxi-v3 environment provided by Gymnasium. The goal is to develop and train an RL agent to efficiently navigate the taxi in the grid world, picking up and dropping off passengers while maximizing rewards.
